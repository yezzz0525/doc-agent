# Dockerfiles

While it is possible to convert a Spring Boot uber jar into a Docker image with just a few lines in the Dockerfile, using the layering feature will result in an optimized image.
When you create a jar containing the layers index file, the spring-boot-jarmode-tools jar will be added as a dependency to your jar.
With this jar on the classpath, you can launch your application in a special mode which allows the bootstrap code to run something entirely different from your application, for example, something that extracts the layers.

Here’s how you can launch your jar with a tools jar mode:

```
$ java -Djarmode=tools -jar my-app.jar
```

This will provide the following output:

```
Usage:
  java -Djarmode=tools -jar my-app.jar

Available commands:
  extract      Extract the contents from the jar
  list-layers  List layers from the jar that can be extracted
  help         Help about any command
```

The extract command can be used to easily split the application into layers to be added to the Dockerfile.
Here is an example of a Dockerfile using jarmode.

```
# Perform the extraction in a separate builder container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:25-cds AS builder
WORKDIR /builder

# This points to the built jar file in the target folder
# Adjust this to 'build/libs/*.jar' if you're using Gradle
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar

# Copy the jar file to the working directory and rename it to application.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} application.jar

# Extract the jar file using an efficient layout
RUN java -Djarmode=tools -jar application.jar extract --layers --destination extracted

# This is the runtime container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:25-cds
WORKDIR /application

# Copy the extracted jar contents from the builder container into the working directory in the runtime container
# Every copy step creates a new docker layer
# This allows docker to only pull the changes it really needs
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/application/ ./
# Start the application jar - this is not the uber jar used by the builder
# This jar only contains application code and references to the extracted jar files
# This layout is efficient to start up and AOT cache (and CDS) friendly
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
```

Assuming the above Dockerfile is in the current directory, your Docker image can be built with docker build ., or optionally specifying the path to your application jar, as shown in the following example:

```
$ docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=path/to/myapp.jar .
```

This is a multi-stage Dockerfile.
The builder stage extracts the directories that are needed later.
Each of the COPY commands relates to the layers extracted by the jarmode.

Of course, a Dockerfile can be written without using the jarmode.
You can use some combination of unzip and mv to move things to the right layer but jarmode simplifies that.
Additionally, the layout created by the jarmode is AOT cache (and CDS) friendly out of the box.

## AOT cache

If you are using Java 25 or above, and want to additionally enable the AOT cache, you can use this Dockerfile:

```
# Perform the extraction in a separate builder container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:25-cds AS builder
WORKDIR /builder

# This points to the built jar file in the target folder
# Adjust this to 'build/libs/*.jar' if you're using Gradle
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar

# Copy the jar file to the working directory and rename it to application.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} application.jar

# Extract the jar file using an efficient layout
RUN java -Djarmode=tools -jar application.jar extract --layers --destination extracted

# This is the runtime container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:25-cds
WORKDIR /application

# Copy the extracted jar contents from the builder container into the working directory in the runtime container
# Every copy step creates a new docker layer
# This allows docker to only pull the changes it really needs
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/application/ ./

# Execute the AOT cache training run
RUN java -XX:AOTCacheOutput=app.aot -Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh -jar application.jar

# Start the application jar with AOT cache enabled - this is not the uber jar used by the builder
# This jar only contains application code and references to the extracted jar files
# This layout is efficient to start up and AOT cache friendly
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-XX:AOTCache=app.aot", "-jar", "application.jar"]
```

This is mostly the same as the above Dockerfile.
As the last steps, it creates the AOT cache file by doing a training run and passes the AOT cache parameter to java -jar.

## CDS

If you’re using Java 24 or later, please use AOT cache instead of CDS.

If you want to additionally enable CDS, you can use this Dockerfile:

```
# Perform the extraction in a separate builder container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:25-cds AS builder
WORKDIR /builder

# This points to the built jar file in the target folder
# Adjust this to 'build/libs/*.jar' if you're using Gradle
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar

# Copy the jar file to the working directory and rename it to application.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} application.jar

# Extract the jar file using an efficient layout
RUN java -Djarmode=tools -jar application.jar extract --layers --destination extracted

# This is the runtime container
FROM bellsoft/liberica-openjre-debian:25-cds
WORKDIR /application

# Copy the extracted jar contents from the builder container into the working directory in the runtime container
# Every copy step creates a new docker layer
# This allows docker to only pull the changes it really needs
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=builder /builder/extracted/application/ ./

# Execute the CDS training run
RUN java -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=application.jsa -Dspring.context.exit=onRefresh -jar application.jar

# Start the application jar with CDS enabled - this is not the uber jar used by the builder
# This jar only contains application code and references to the extracted jar files
# This layout is efficient to start up and CDS friendly
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-XX:SharedArchiveFile=application.jsa", "-jar", "application.jar"]
```

This is mostly the same as the above Dockerfile.
As the last steps, it creates the CDS archive by doing a training run and passes the CDS parameter to java -jar.

If you are using Java 25 or above, we recommend using an AOT cache instead of CDS.
